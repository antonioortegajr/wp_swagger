WP Swagger

A Swagger UI in your WP pages.


As the WP REST API grows I want to have docs in place. This because ib want peyote to consume my api easily. 

The Swagger UI is one of my favorites and with this plugin I can offer API docs for my custom routes.


Normal Pet Store example included.

To use you will need to edit the Swagger UI manually.

Add a suicide to your page or post.
